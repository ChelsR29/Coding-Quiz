# Coding-Quiz

## Description

With this project the user can take a timed coding quiz. The quiz consist of 10 random questions regarding coding that can help better understand basic coding concepts. This project was built to help me better understand Web APIs, I more specifically learned a great deal about addEventListener, document.getElementByID, style.display, and functions/what to input in these functions to get them to work the way I need them to.
